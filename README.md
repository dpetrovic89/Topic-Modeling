# Topic Modeling

Two approaches to try to lazily get some information from your texts are **topic modeling** and **clustering**.

**Topic modeling** is if each document can be about **multiple topics**. There might be 100 different topics, and a document might be 30% about one topic, 20% about another, and then 50% spread out between the others.

**Clustering** is if each document should only fit into **one topic**. It's an all-or-nothing approach.

### Datasets used in notebook
**Recipes** analyzing about 36,000 recipes.

**State of the Union addresses**
At the beginning of each year, the President of the United States traditionally addresses Congress in a speech called the State of the Union. It's a good way to judge what's important in the country at the time, because the speech is sure to be used as a platform to address the legislative agenda for the year.
